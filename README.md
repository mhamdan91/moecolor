## Overview
This lightweight tool allows to color terminal text and style it based on predefined attributes. The tool works very much like the `print` function.
Except it is a fancier print that you can do a lot more with to control text color and style.

## Library Installalion
To install the library simply run the following command in a cmd, shell or whatever...

```bash
# It's recommended to create a virtual environment

# Windows
pip install moecolor

# Linux
pip3 install moecolor
```

## Library usage?
The following examples shows how to print text in `green` in so many different ways:
```python
from moecolor import print
print('My example text as green', color='green')
print('My example text as green', color='#00FF00')
print('My example text as green', color=(0, 255, 0))
print('My example text as green', color=(10,))
print('My example text as green', color=10)
```

The following example shows how to underline, cross-out, bold, italize, a red text:
```python
from moecolor import print
print('My example text as green', color='red', attr=['bold', 'italic', 'strike', 'underline'])
```

### Usage Guidelines
The tool simply overloads the `print` function, so you can use it as a normal print or if you like to color the text you can provide extra arguments.
The tool accepts the following arguments in addition to the kwargs accepted by the builtin `print` function.
- color
- attr
- usage

You can so many options to choose from to color your text. You can:
- Choose a color string from a list of pre-defined colors ['BLACK', 'RED', 'GREEN', 'YELLOW', 'BLUE', 'MAGENTA', 'CYAN', 'BRIGHT_GRAY', 'DEFAULT', 'DARK_GRAY',
  'BRIGHT_RED', 'BRIGHT_GREEN', 'BRIGHT_YELLOW', 'BRIGHT_BLUE', 'BRIGHT_MAGENTA', 'BRIGHT_CYAN','WHITE', 'PURPLE', 'VOILET', 'LIME', 'ORANGE', 'RANDOM']
- If you wish to generate a random color, you can supply the word: 'RANDOM'.
- If you wish to pick a color from 256-color mode scale based on `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit`, you can provide an integer between [0-255]
- If you wish to provide an RGB value for a specific 24-bit color, you provide a tuple/list of RGB values: (R, G, B) and numbers must be integers between [0-255]
- If you wish to provide a hex-code for an 24-bit RGB equivelent color, you can provide a string like `#FFFFFF`.

To style your text, you can use a set of pre-defined attributes:
- 'BOLD': **bolds text** (synonymous options: 'b', 'bold', 'thick')
- 'DIM': dmis text a little (synonymous options: 'dim', 'dark', 'd')
- 'ITALIC': *italize text* (synonymous options: 'i', 'italic')
- 'UNDERLINE': underlines text, (synonymous options: 'u', 'underline')
- 'BLINK': makes text blink at less than 150 times per minute (synonymous options: 'blink', 'blinking', 'flash')
- 'INVERT': inverts text (synonymous options: 'reverse', 'invert', 'switch')
- 'HIDE': hide text from terminal (synonymous options: 'conceal', 'hide', 'invisible')
- 'STRIKE': ~~makes text crossed-out~~, (synonymous options: 'crossed-out', 'cross-out', 'crossed-out', 'strike', 's')
- 'DOUBLE-UNDERLINE': underline text with double lines, (synonymous options: 'double-underline', '2u', 'uu', 'du')
- 'FOREGROUND': controls foreground color [default behavior], (synonymous options: 'foreground', 'fg', 'fore-ground')
- 'BACKGROUND': controls background color [to apply color the background instead of the foreground], (synonymous options: 'background' ,'bg', 'back-ground')
- 'OVERLINED': overlines text (synonymous options: 'overlined', 'o', 'over-lined')
- 'UNDERLINE-COLOR': applies color to underlined text, used along with underlining, otherwise no effect (synonymous options: underline-color', 'ucolor', 'u-color', 'uc')
- 'CLEAR': clear screen, then print text. (synonymous options: 'reset', 'reset-position', 'clear', 'clear-screen')

To show tool usage, or this README, i.e., you supply the keyword `usage` or one of its synonymous ('h', 'usage', 'show_help', 'help_me', 'use') as follows:
```python
print(usage=True)
```
You can also display tool usage using the following command
```python
help(print)
```


```python
# Note, all strings are case insensitive, you don't worry :)

"""
Some attributes may not be supported in all terminals. So, if a specific attribute does not work, that means the
terminal you are using does not support it. 

Windows terminals (CMD, PS) support most of attributes, but the following ['blink', 'dim']
LINUX terminals support all AFAIK
